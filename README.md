# ansible-sshd
This role sets up an OpenSSH daemon with hardened default configuration. Wherever possible, security was chosen over compatibility.

**This Ansible role is a utility submodule to [my one-stop-shop infrastructure configuration](https://github.com/silanea/cds-ansible).**
I do my best to keep my roles clean and isolated, but they are not intended to be used on their own.

# Here Be Dragons!
This role is not stable yet!
